# earth_data_cloud_clinic_geoweaver

This is the workflow in Geoweaver replicated from Openscapes 2i2c. The workflow aims to discover data using earthengine search, request a subset of data from the GHRSST Level 4 MUR Global Foundation Sea Surface Temperature Analysis (v4.1) dataset using a vector-based geospatial file.

In both scenarios, we will be accessing data directly from Amazon Web Services (AWS), specifically in the us-west-2 region, which is where all cloud-hosted NASA Earthdata reside.
